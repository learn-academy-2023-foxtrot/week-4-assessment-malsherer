# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object oriented programming is a paradigm that uses objects to define data and behavior. Functional programming focuses on defining behavior and data as mathematical functions, which is more abstract. Object oriented programming corresponds better to the way the human mind works in real life (at least for me ðŸ˜‡)

Researched answer: Object oriented programming is more dynamic and allows for mutable objects, whereas functions are not as able to change over time.

2. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: It is not necessary to include the keyword return in Ruby methods, unlike JavaScript functions.

Researched answer: This makes Ruby code more concise and readable.

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: Blocks contain the code logic within a method, typically wrapped within the terms "do" and "end"

Researched answer: A signle line can be converted to curly braces, but the best practice is to use do and end for multiple lines

4. How do you extract a single value from a Ruby hash?

Your answer: A single value can be extracted from a Ruby hash by specifying the value and key in this syntax: example_hash["example value"]

Researched answer: If the key doesn't exactly match a key within the hash it will return nil

5. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Your answer: A version manager is used to track changes in a code and different versions of an application (like git?)

Researched answer: There are several version managers for different coding languages (like RVM for Ruby)

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Test-driven development: Test-driven development is using tests as you code, like what we have been learning with Jest in JavaScript

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is a database management system

3. CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete: represents four basic operations for managing data in a storage system (database)
